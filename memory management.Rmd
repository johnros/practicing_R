# Duplication of objects when passed to functions
It does not matter how you pass an object to a function. Just make sure the objects are as simple as needed.


Matrix does not create a copy:
```{r}

A <- rnorm(1e6)
tracemem(A)
foo <- function(B) sum(B)
A <- rnorm(1e6)
tracemem(A)
foo(A)


```


Data frames create copies:
```{r}

C<- data.frame(A)
tracemem(C)
foo(C)

bar <- function() sum(A)
bar()

bar2 <- function() sum(C)
bar2()

```
